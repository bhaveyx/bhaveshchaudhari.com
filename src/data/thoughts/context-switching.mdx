I'm working a full-time job during the day, spending a couple of hours on fitness & diet at night, then pouring time into side projects, reading, learning, journaling, and building an audience on Twitter.

Doing all these things has made me realize how powerful the skill of context switching is. Shifting between tasks without getting stuck on what was just done is the only way to stay focused. When I don't switch contexts smoothly, I lose sleep, my routine falls apart and I end up overwhelmed, which I know leads straight to burnout.

Resetting my mind on demand is the real challenge, but I believe with enough practice and composure, it can be done.
